# MovieApp
SDU android programming project

Project Description: Movie App
We will create the movie application that the user can create their own list to keep their favorite movies. The project that we create will be based on these following tools: 
•	External Library to get images of movie.
•	Web service to get movies data from website.
•	Fragments to support the layout of both phone and tablet devices.
•	Database to create the list of user's favorite movies.
While we were working with this project, it has a lot of problems occur. First, we tried to use fragment to support both phone and tablet layout. We applied the fragment into our code and it doesn't work properly. So, we created layout and grid for each of devices which are phone, 7 inches tablet and 10 inches tablet instead of using fragment. Next, we want to have user’s favorite list for each user. So, we use https://www.000webhost.com/ to created external database for the user section(log in, sign up, and log out) and tried to connect our favorite SQLite database in the application. We failed to connect it together but we still have a favorite movies list. Then we notice that our web host has short expiry date so we remove the user section.
